# weather-app
This application shows the current weather and forecast based on the user's location with API service.
In order to run the application, you must have Angular (and Angular material) installed on your computer.
Implemented features:
- I used Angular materials components to make the page responsiveness and well structured
- get current weather from user's location. The user must accept to share the location so the weather info could be loaded into the page
-get forecast weather for the next 3 days
-get weather for different cities and add them to favourite list. If the temperature is below 15 degrees, the image is blue, if it's above 15 degrees, the image is changed with a nice sunny picture.
